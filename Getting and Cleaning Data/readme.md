================

##there are many way to create a clean and tidy data.i think my way is not pretty.so,let's go.
 
##i didn't do it in order the teacher suggested,maybe ,it's a little hard to read.
 
###at  first,i read the train dataset with the variable "trainda",and the     test with "testda",the train subject with "trainsub",the train label with "trainla",the test label with "testla",the test subject with"testsub".then i  coerce trainla and testla to factor .now,i merge the all data and get two dataset named with train and test.

###second,name test and train,then merge them to a new data named da Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.then we get a new data named newda.

###at last.creates a independent tidy data set with the average of each 
##variable for each activity and each subject.
