====================

the dataset nnewdat have 180 rows and 68 cols or variables
the names of variables are:

##kindsofactivity:factor,6levels,six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIS        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

##subjectpeople:int,the number stands for the 30 volunteers

##These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  

##These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
